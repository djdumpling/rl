       "  'expected_answer': \"While spinors are often introduced using complex numbers, it is possible to understand their existence in three-dimensional space without explicitly using them. Here's a simplified explanation:\\n\\n1. **Vector Spaces and Linear Transformations**:\\n   - In linear algebra, a vector space is a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars (numbers).\\n   - Linear transformations are functions that map vectors from one vector space to another while preserving certain properties.\\n\\n2. **Rotations in Three Dimensions**:\\n   - Rotations in three dimensions can be represented as linear transformations that preserve the length of vectors.\\n   - These rotations form a group called the special orthogonal group, denoted as SO(3).\\n\\n3. **Spinors as Double-Valued Representations**:\\n   - Spinors are mathematical objects that can be used to represent rotations in three dimensions.\\n   - Unlike vectors, which have a single value at each point in space, spinors have two values.\\n   - This double-valued nature of spinors is related to the fact that a rotation of 360 degrees (2π radians) brings a vector back to its original orientation but changes the sign of a spinor.\\n\\n4. **Construction of Spinors without Complex Numbers**:\\n   - Spinors can be constructed using real numbers without explicitly involving complex numbers.\\n   - One way to do this is to use quaternions, which are a four-dimensional extension of the real numbers.\\n   - Quaternions can be used to represent rotations in three dimensions, and spinors can be constructed from quaternions.\\n\\n5. **Applications of Spinors**:\\n   - Spinors have important applications in various fields, including physics and computer graphics.\\n   - In physics, spinors are used to describe the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of particles.\\n   - In computer graphics, spinors are used for representing rotations and orientations in three-dimensional space.\\n\\nIt's important to note that while this explanation provides a basic understanding of the existence of spinors in three dimensions without using complex numbers, a more rigorous mathematical treatment would involve concepts such as Clifford algebras and group representations.\",\n",

       "  'orig_question': '(Dear mods, I have edited the question. The previous version was probably too confused.) I can convince myself that spinors exist in 2D using complex numbers. The elementary example is a (complex number) $f (\\\\theta) = \\\\exp(i \\\\theta /2)$. When the argument is increased by $2\\\\pi$, it flips sign ($\\\\exp(i (\\\\theta + 2\\\\pi) /2) $ = $-\\\\exp(i \\\\theta /2)$), and requires another rotation of $2\\\\pi$ to bring it back to the original value, and it is therefore a spinor. I want to understand why we can deduce, hopefully in a similarly easy way, that spinors can exist even in a three (odd-dimensional) space. Thanks',\n",
       "  'orig_answer': 'This answer is not an elementary explanation for the existence of spinors, but pointers to references which might allow an elementary understanding of spinors, hopefully sufficient enough to understand their construction, and thus why they exist.\\n\\nAccording to Wikipedia, \\n\\n\\n  ...Spinors may be regarded as non-normalised rotors in which the reverse rather than the inverse is used in the sandwich product.\\n\\n\\nThus I propose attempting to first understand rotors, and then leveraging that knowledge to try to understand spinors. This may or may not work for you, but is one approach I feel might be worth keeping in the back of your pocket in case other approaches do not work.\\n\\n\\nProbably the simplest introduction to rotors I have been able to find is this tutorial introduction by Gull, Lasenby, and Doran (available for free online here). The first section is an introduction, the third section discusses rotors.\\nPerhaps the second-simplest introduction to rotors I have been able to find is MacDonald\\'s survey (available for free online here) -- rotors are already explained in the second section.\\nChisholm gives a very readable introduction to rotors (available for free online here), which however does not mention spinors.\\nPerhaps more abstract (although on the other hand also with more pictures) is the treatment given by Lundholm and Svensson (available for free online here), which does at the end define and discuss spinors.\\n\\n\\nA readable introduction to both rotors and spinors can be found in Alan Bromborksy\\'s book (available for free online here) introduces rotors in the first chapter and spinors in the second chapter. Keep in mind though that it seems somewhat fast-paced, so it probably is not an elementary introduction. I am not sure though since I have not read all of it myself.\\n     UPDATE3 In reply to: \\n\\n\"why we can deduce, ... that spinors can exist even in a three (odd-dimensional) space\"\\n\\nDo we ever deduce that? Or do we define it?  \\n\\nRespectfully: I think you\\'re still thinking about these objects as being \"in\" the space they\\'re associated with. \\n\\nSpinors live in a spinor space, even when they refer to something in another space. \\n\\nTry looking at it this way: I would agree that we can describe e.g. vector fields in which there is a 3D vector associated with each point in, for example, physical (3D) space. But the vectors are still elements of a vector space, they are not part of the real space even though we assign their position and coordinates using physical space measures. \\n\\nHowever, I see no reason why one couldn\\'t define vectors of any number of dimensions associated with a space of any other number of dimensions, without the coordinates necessarily measuring aspects of the space with which they are associated.\\n\\n(Forgive me if this isn\\'t maths so much as pedagogy): Imagine, if you will, a fine 2-dimensional lattice (not quite a continuous space) representing the surface of an agricultural zone on planet Earth. At various points we can identify farms (by, say, the lattice-location closest to their farm office) with different combinations of produce, and if there are, say, 57 varieties of produce across all the farms, then we can associate a 57D vector, one per farm, with some points in the 2D lattice... \\n\\nUPDATE2 (in reply to modified question)\\nYour identification of the usual complex numbers as being themselves spinors, while not widely recognised as such AFAIK, is consistent with the views of the estimable David Hestenes who has done much to bring Geometric Algebra to the attention of physicists.You might do well to start with http://geometry.mrao.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ImagNumbersArentReal.pdf in which is demonstrated more clearly the spinorial character of your exp(iθ/2), using a bilinear transformation of vectors.\\n\\nUPDATE in reply to Comment below from OP (and written prior to OP\\'s revision of original question):\\nAre you thinking of complex numbers or spinors as being \"in\" the manifold? it might be better to think of them as simply associated to it, but not \"living inside\" it. For example, a quaternion (which some recognise as a form of spinor) describing a rotation in R3 is (in my limited understanding) an element of a quaternion-space that happens to be able to describe a particular rotation, but is not itself \"in\" R3. \\n\\nThere was an earlier comment suggesting that mathematicians had moved on from concern with spinors, and I guess the commenter was pointing in the direction of Clifford Algebras and beyond.\\n\\nSo, if you haven\\'t seen them already, you might want to look at the ever-expanding Wiki pages on Clifford Algebras and the one on Spinors. Though they refer to Reals, it\\'s still not clear to me that spinors can be described without at least implicitly involving complex numbers. For example: the Spinor wiki page says: \\n\\n\"Thus the (real) spinors in three-dimensions are quaternions_\" \\n\\n\\n...yet the quaternion unit vectors i, j, k obey relations like i^2 = -1 (referring now to a pi-rotation).\\n\\nThe Reals, R(1), considered as a primordial Clifford Algebra, sit at the top of a pyramidal table of Clifford Algebras (below which sit the Complex Numbers C(1), together with R(2), and another level down the quaternions, H(1)), so it seems clear that not all Clifford Algebras admit spinors, but I leave it to someone more expert to say just which ones definitely don\\'t admit spinors. \\n\\nIf you find the Wiki pages hard-going, another route in is via the late Pertti Lounesto\\'s wonderful compendium, \"Clifford Algebras and Spinors\" (London Mathematical Society/Cambridge U. Press), which starts at an elementary level, though it\\'s now quite expensive and may be hard to get.\\n\\nORIGINAL REPLY (To initial version of question since edited by OP)\\n\\nHow have you reached the conclusion that \"spinor geometry is independent of the existence of complex numbers\"?\\n\\nI am likely at the same level as yourself in pursuing such insights (though trivially elementary to mathematicians - except, famously, to Sir Michael Atiyah).\\n\\nHowever, in my limited physicist\\'s understanding, spinors are indissolubly linked to some sense of rotation/angle; and complex numbers are, in geometric terms, about manipulating changes of angle (rotation), so I would be surprised - and also interested to learn - if spinors can be encoded without complex/hypercomplex numbers, either explicitly or implicitly.\\n    ',\n",

Is it true that every number is equal to either $0$ or $1$.\\n\\nIt took me a lot of thinking but I finally came up with an example of a number that was not equal to $-1$ or $0$.  $1$ is not $-1$ nor $0$.

(It was the only one I could come up with)  But we only need one counter example.\\n     Consider the relation\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nb=a(a+1),\\n\\\\end{equation}\\ndefine a string to be a sequence of numbers such that each is related to the ones before and after it, i.e.,\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\na_{n+1}=a_n(a_n+1).\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nThis can be viewed as a dynamical system, with $n$ playing the role of time.  Note that if $T:\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{C}$ is the time evolution operator given by\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nT(x)=x(x+1),\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nthen the inverse time evolution operator on (the powerset of) $\\\\mathbb{C}$, $T^{-1}:\\\\mathbb{P(C)}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{P(C)}$, is given by\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nT^{-1}(\\\\{x\\\\})=\\\\begin{cases}\\\\left\\\\{\\\\frac{-1+\\\\sqrt{1+4x}}{2},\\\\frac{-1-\\\\sqrt{1+4x}}{2}\\\\right\\\\}&\\\\text{, if } x\\\\neq-\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\\\\\\\\\left\\\\{-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right\\\\}&\\\\text{, if }x=-\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\end{cases}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nSo, given a value in a string, all \"future\" values are determined, while in general \"past\" values need not be uniquely determined.\\n\\nI interpret the OP\\'s question to be: fix $r,s\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$, does there exist a sequence of $T$\\'s and $T^{-1}$\\'s such that\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nr\\\\in T^{m_N}(T^{-m_{N-1}}(T^{m_{N-2}}(\\\\cdots{}T^{m_1}(T^{-m_0}(s))\\\\cdots{}))),\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $T$ here is the set function induced by $T(x)$ as defined above.\\nSince\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nTT^{-1}=\\\\mathbb{I},\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nthis reduces to: do there exist $m,n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}$ such that\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nr\\\\in T^{-m}(T^{n}(s))\\\\Leftrightarrow T^m(r)=T^n(s)\\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\cup_{p=0}^nT^{-p}(T^p(s))\\\\cap\\\\cup_{q=0}^mT^{-q}(T^q(r))\\\\neq\\\\emptyset.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nCounterexample to OP\\'s conjecture that all algebraic numbers are related: 1 and 3 are not related.  Suppose 1 and 3 were related, then there are smallest non-negative integers $m,n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}$  such that $T^m(1)=T^n(3)$.  $T(1)=2\\\\neq3$, $T(2)=6\\\\neq3$, since $T(x)$ is an increasing function of $x$, $m$ and $n$ must both be positive.  Consider $T^{m-1}(1)$ and $T^{n-1}(3)$.  These must both have positive values, since they are iterations of $T$ applied to positive numbers.  They must also be elements of $T^{-1}(\\\\{T^m(1)\\\\})=T^{-1}(\\\\{T^n(3)\\\\})$.  This contradicts the fact that for $x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$ with $x>0$, $T^{-1}(\\\\{x\\\\})$ has exactly one positive element and one negative element.\\n\\nConclusion: if one has a string containing 1 and a string containing 3, then these strings do not share any elements.

       "  'expected_answer': \"While spinors are often introduced using complex numbers, it is possible to understand their existence in three-dimensional space without explicitly using them. Here's a simplified explanation:\\n\\n1. **Vector Spaces and Linear Transformations**:\\n   - In linear algebra, a vector space is a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars (numbers).\\n   - Linear transformations are functions that map vectors from one vector space to another while preserving certain properties.\\n\\n2. **Rotations in Three Dimensions**:\\n   - Rotations in three dimensions can be represented as linear transformations that preserve the length of vectors.\\n   - These rotations form a group called the special orthogonal group, denoted as SO(3).\\n\\n3. **Spinors as Double-Valued Representations**:\\n   - Spinors are mathematical objects that can be used to represent rotations in three dimensions.\\n   - Unlike vectors, which have a single value at each point in space, spinors have two values.\\n   - This double-valued nature of spinors is related to the fact that a rotation of 360 degrees (2π radians) brings a vector back to its original orientation but changes the sign of a spinor.\\n\\n4. **Construction of Spinors without Complex Numbers**:\\n   - Spinors can be constructed using real numbers without explicitly involving complex numbers.\\n   - One way to do this is to use quaternions, which are a four-dimensional extension of the real numbers.\\n   - Quaternions can be used to represent rotations in three dimensions, and spinors can be constructed from quaternions.\\n\\n5. **Applications of Spinors**:\\n   - Spinors have important applications in various fields, including physics and computer graphics.\\n   - In physics, spinors are used to describe the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of particles.\\n   - In computer graphics, spinors are used for representing rotations and orientations in three-dimensional space.\\n\\nIt's important to note that while this explanation provides a basic understanding of the existence of spinors in three dimensions without using complex numbers, a more rigorous mathematical treatment would involve concepts such as Clifford algebras and group representations.\",\n",

       "  'orig_question': '(Dear mods, I have edited the question. The previous version was probably too confused.) I can convince myself that spinors exist in 2D using complex numbers. The elementary example is a (complex number) $f (\\\\theta) = \\\\exp(i \\\\theta /2)$. When the argument is increased by $2\\\\pi$, it flips sign ($\\\\exp(i (\\\\theta + 2\\\\pi) /2) $ = $-\\\\exp(i \\\\theta /2)$), and requires another rotation of $2\\\\pi$ to bring it back to the original value, and it is therefore a spinor. I want to understand why we can deduce, hopefully in a similarly easy way, that spinors can exist even in a three (odd-dimensional) space. Thanks',\n",
       "  'orig_answer': 'This answer is not an elementary explanation for the existence of spinors, but pointers to references which might allow an elementary understanding of spinors, hopefully sufficient enough to understand their construction, and thus why they exist.\\n\\nAccording to Wikipedia, \\n\\n\\n  ...Spinors may be regarded as non-normalised rotors in which the reverse rather than the inverse is used in the sandwich product.\\n\\n\\nThus I propose attempting to first understand rotors, and then leveraging that knowledge to try to understand spinors. This may or may not work for you, but is one approach I feel might be worth keeping in the back of your pocket in case other approaches do not work.\\n\\n\\nProbably the simplest introduction to rotors I have been able to find is this tutorial introduction by Gull, Lasenby, and Doran (available for free online here). The first section is an introduction, the third section discusses rotors.\\nPerhaps the second-simplest introduction to rotors I have been able to find is MacDonald\\'s survey (available for free online here) -- rotors are already explained in the second section.\\nChisholm gives a very readable introduction to rotors (available for free online here), which however does not mention spinors.\\nPerhaps more abstract (although on the other hand also with more pictures) is the treatment given by Lundholm and Svensson (available for free online here), which does at the end define and discuss spinors.\\n\\n\\nA readable introduction to both rotors and spinors can be found in Alan Bromborksy\\'s book (available for free online here) introduces rotors in the first chapter and spinors in the second chapter. Keep in mind though that it seems somewhat fast-paced, so it probably is not an elementary introduction. I am not sure though since I have not read all of it myself.\\n     UPDATE3 In reply to: \\n\\n\"why we can deduce, ... that spinors can exist even in a three (odd-dimensional) space\"\\n\\nDo we ever deduce that? Or do we define it?  \\n\\nRespectfully: I think you\\'re still thinking about these objects as being \"in\" the space they\\'re associated with. \\n\\nSpinors live in a spinor space, even when they refer to something in another space. \\n\\nTry looking at it this way: I would agree that we can describe e.g. vector fields in which there is a 3D vector associated with each point in, for example, physical (3D) space. But the vectors are still elements of a vector space, they are not part of the real space even though we assign their position and coordinates using physical space measures. \\n\\nHowever, I see no reason why one couldn\\'t define vectors of any number of dimensions associated with a space of any other number of dimensions, without the coordinates necessarily measuring aspects of the space with which they are associated.\\n\\n(Forgive me if this isn\\'t maths so much as pedagogy): Imagine, if you will, a fine 2-dimensional lattice (not quite a continuous space) representing the surface of an agricultural zone on planet Earth. At various points we can identify farms (by, say, the lattice-location closest to their farm office) with different combinations of produce, and if there are, say, 57 varieties of produce across all the farms, then we can associate a 57D vector, one per farm, with some points in the 2D lattice... \\n\\nUPDATE2 (in reply to modified question)\\nYour identification of the usual complex numbers as being themselves spinors, while not widely recognised as such AFAIK, is consistent with the views of the estimable David Hestenes who has done much to bring Geometric Algebra to the attention of physicists.You might do well to start with http://geometry.mrao.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ImagNumbersArentReal.pdf in which is demonstrated more clearly the spinorial character of your exp(iθ/2), using a bilinear transformation of vectors.\\n\\nUPDATE in reply to Comment below from OP (and written prior to OP\\'s revision of original question):\\nAre you thinking of complex numbers or spinors as being \"in\" the manifold? it might be better to think of them as simply associated to it, but not \"living inside\" it. For example, a quaternion (which some recognise as a form of spinor) describing a rotation in R3 is (in my limited understanding) an element of a quaternion-space that happens to be able to describe a particular rotation, but is not itself \"in\" R3. \\n\\nThere was an earlier comment suggesting that mathematicians had moved on from concern with spinors, and I guess the commenter was pointing in the direction of Clifford Algebras and beyond.\\n\\nSo, if you haven\\'t seen them already, you might want to look at the ever-expanding Wiki pages on Clifford Algebras and the one on Spinors. Though they refer to Reals, it\\'s still not clear to me that spinors can be described without at least implicitly involving complex numbers. For example: the Spinor wiki page says: \\n\\n\"Thus the (real) spinors in three-dimensions are quaternions_\" \\n\\n\\n...yet the quaternion unit vectors i, j, k obey relations like i^2 = -1 (referring now to a pi-rotation).\\n\\nThe Reals, R(1), considered as a primordial Clifford Algebra, sit at the top of a pyramidal table of Clifford Algebras (below which sit the Complex Numbers C(1), together with R(2), and another level down the quaternions, H(1)), so it seems clear that not all Clifford Algebras admit spinors, but I leave it to someone more expert to say just which ones definitely don\\'t admit spinors. \\n\\nIf you find the Wiki pages hard-going, another route in is via the late Pertti Lounesto\\'s wonderful compendium, \"Clifford Algebras and Spinors\" (London Mathematical Society/Cambridge U. Press), which starts at an elementary level, though it\\'s now quite expensive and may be hard to get.\\n\\nORIGINAL REPLY (To initial version of question since edited by OP)\\n\\nHow have you reached the conclusion that \"spinor geometry is independent of the existence of complex numbers\"?\\n\\nI am likely at the same level as yourself in pursuing such insights (though trivially elementary to mathematicians - except, famously, to Sir Michael Atiyah).\\n\\nHowever, in my limited physicist\\'s understanding, spinors are indissolubly linked to some sense of rotation/angle; and complex numbers are, in geometric terms, about manipulating changes of angle (rotation), so I would be surprised - and also interested to learn - if spinors can be encoded without complex/hypercomplex numbers, either explicitly or implicitly.\\n    ',\n",

Note that if $T:\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{C}$ is the time evolution operator given by\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nT(x)=x(x+1),\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nthen the inverse time evolution operator on (the powerset of) $\\\\mathbb{C}$, $T^{-1}:\\\\mathbb{P(C)}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{P(C)}$, is given by\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nT^{-1}(\\\\{x\\\\})=\\\\begin{cases}\\\\left\\\\{\\\\frac{-1+\\\\sqrt{1+4x}}{2},\\\\frac{-1-\\\\sqrt{1+4x}}{2}\\\\right\\\\}&\\\\text{, if } x\\\\neq-\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\\\\\\\\\left\\\\{-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right\\\\}&\\\\text{, if }x=-\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\end{cases}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nSo, given a value in a string, all \"future\" values are determined, while in general \"past\" values need not be uniquely determined.\\n\\nI interpret the OP\\'s question to be: fix $r,s\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$, does there exist a sequence of $T$\\'s and $T^{-1}$\\'s such that\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nr\\\\in T^{m_N}(T^{-m_{N-1}}(T^{m_{N-2}}(\\\\cdots{}T^{m_1}(T^{-m_0}(s))\\\\cdots{}))),\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $T$ here is the set function induced by $T(x)$ as defined above.\\nSince\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nTT^{-1}=\\\\mathbb{I},\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nthis reduces to: do there exist $m,n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}$ such that\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nr\\\\in T^{-m}(T^{n}(s))\\\\Leftrightarrow T^m(r)=T^n(s)\\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\cup_{p=0}^nT^{-p}(T^p(s))\\\\cap\\\\cup_{q=0}^mT^{-q}(T^q(r))\\\\neq\\\\emptyset.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nCounterexample to OP\\'s conjecture that all algebraic numbers are related: 1 and 3 are not related.  Suppose 1 and 3 were related, then there are smallest non-negative integers $m,n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}$  such that $T^m(1)=T^n(3)$.  $T(1)=2\\\\neq3$, $T(2)=6\\\\neq3$, since $T(x)$ is an increasing function of $x$, $m$ and $n$ must both be positive.  Consider $T^{m-1}(1)$ and $T^{n-1}(3)$.  These must both have positive values, since they are iterations of $T$ applied to positive numbers.  They must also be elements of $T^{-1}(\\\\{T^m(1)\\\\})=T^{-1}(\\\\{T^n(3)\\\\})$.  This contradicts the fact that for $x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$ with $x>0$, $T^{-1}(\\\\{x\\\\})$ has exactly one positive element and one negative element.\\n\\nConclusion: if one has a string containing 1 and a string containing 3, then these strings do not share any elements.

       " '\\n\\nAnswer: I will only understand the understanding of the spinors in three-dimensional space without relying on complex numbers. Without complex numbers, it would be difficult to provide a definitive explanation for the existence of spinors. Additionally, the spinors in three-dimensional space would still provide a basis for understanding the properties of particles, such as wave functions, wave functions in 3D space, and the behavior of particles in 3D space, which are still fundamental concepts in physics.',\n",
