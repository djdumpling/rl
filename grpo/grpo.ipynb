Also my prof and T.A. said I should do $f(1)=f(-1)$ then solve it then do $f''(0)=0$ somewhere along the lines but I don't understand how to go about doing it that way. PLEASE!! Can someone solve it doing it that way and not using matrices because for these questions you don't need to use matrices to solve it.\",\n",

Express the fact that this coefficient is zero. The result will be an equation that lets you eliminate either $a$ or $c.$\\n\\nTo recapitulate: $f(1)=f(-1)=0$ lets you factor $f(x),$ leaving only three unknown parameters, and $f''(0)=0$ gives you a relationship among those unknowns, allowing you to reduce them to two.\\n\\nI think writing $f(x)$ in its factored form makes it especially simple to rewrite it as a linear combination of two polynomials.\\n    \",\n",
