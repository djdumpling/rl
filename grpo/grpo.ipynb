The slope of the given line \\\\( x - 7y = 9 \\\\) can be found by rewriting it in standard form: \\\\( x - 7y - 9 = 0 \\\\), which gives \\\\( a = 1 \\\\) and \\\\( b = -7 \\\\).

The slope of a line perpendicular to the given line is the negative reciprocal of its slope, which is \\\\( -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{7}} = -7 \\\\).\\n\\n3. Using the point-slope form, the equation of the line passing through \\\\( (5, 4) \\\\) with slope \\\\( -7 \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{y - 4}{x - 5} = -7 \\\\).\\n\\n4.

For each element h ∈ G, define the linear transformation ϕ_h: M → M by ϕ_h(m) = hm for all m ∈ M.\\n2. Since K is algebraically closed, each ϕ_h has an eigenvalue λ ∈ K.\\n3. Let ϕ_h - λI be the linear transformation, where I is the identity on M. For any g ∈ G and m ∈ M, we have:\\n   (ϕ_h - λI)gm = g(ϕ_h - λI)m.\\n4. This shows that ϕ_h - λI is a K[G]-module homomorphism. By Schur's lemma, since it is not invertible (as λ is an eigenvalue), it must be the zero map.\\n5. Consequently, ϕ_h = λI, implying hm = λm for all m ∈ M and h ∈ G. This implies that every one-dimensional subspace of M is a K[G]-submodule.\\n6. If M were not one-dimensional, there would be a contradiction to the simplicity of M. Therefore, M must be one-dimensional.\\n\\nFurthermore, Maschke's theorem, applied to the commutative semisimple ring K[G], tells us that K[G] is isomorphic to a finite direct product of copies of K. Each simple K[G] module is isomorphic to K[G]/M for some maximal ideal M, with the maximal ideals corresponding to specific elements of G. This ensures that simple modules are isomorphic to K as K modules but not necessarily as K[G] modules, preserving the distinctness of the modules according to the group elements.\\n\\nIn conclusion, a simple K[G] module M over a finite abelian group G and an algebraically closed field K has dimension 1 over K.\",\n",

Instead, try this:\\n\\nFor $h\\\\in G$, let $\\\\phi_h:M\\\\to M$ be the linear transformation given by $\\\\phi_h(m)=hm$ for all $m\\\\in M$.

Each simple $R$ module is isomorphic to $R/M$ for some maximal ideal $M$ of $R$, and of course the maximal ideals of $R$ are just those sets of all elements which are zero on a particular fixed position. \\n\\nThis clearly makes all simple modules isomorphic to $K$ as $K$ modules, but they are pairwise nonisomorphic as $K[G]$ modules.
